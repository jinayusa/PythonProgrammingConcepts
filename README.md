Introduction
This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive guide for learning Python. It contains a variety of code examples that cover fundamental concepts to complex programming techniques. Each example is accompanied by an explanation of what it does and how it works.

Whether you're just starting with Python or looking to deepen your understanding, you'll find examples and projects here that will enhance your skills.

Structure
The repository is divided into several sections, based on the complexity of the concepts:

Basic Concepts: Simple Python programs to help you understand the syntax and essential features.
Intermediate Concepts: More advanced topics like functions, data structures, and object-oriented programming.
Advanced Concepts: Real-world applications such as decorators, multithreading, file handling, and machine learning models.
Basic Concepts
In this section, you'll find examples of basic Python constructs:

Hello World Program: A simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!".
Variables and Data Types: A demonstration of basic variable types like integers, floats, strings, and booleans.
Functions and Return Values: Shows how to define functions, pass parameters, and return results.
Example:
python
Copy
# Simple Hello World program
print("Hello, World!")
Intermediate Concepts
Here we dive into more advanced topics:

List Comprehension: An efficient way to create lists.
File Handling: Reading from and writing to files.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Classes and objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.
Example:
python
Copy
# List comprehension to create a list of squares
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)
Advanced Concepts
This section covers complex Python concepts such as:

Decorators: Functions that modify the behavior of other functions.
Multithreading: Running multiple threads concurrently.
Machine Learning: Deploying models with Flask APIs.
Example:
python
Copy
# Multithreading Example
import threading

def print_numbers():
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)

# Create and start thread
thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
thread.start()
